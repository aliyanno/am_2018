      We started as a group of eight, exploring ways to tackle and learn from each
      of our assumptions. We used a series of converge and diverge activities
      followed by solo refinement to align on three ideas worth pursuing.

      We presented these back to the main stakeholders for final approval to work
      on these.

      We split into three groups to tackle each idea. I led one group as well as
      managed the overall team effort and final delivery to the stakeholder.
