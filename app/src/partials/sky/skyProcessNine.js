      My group was focused on learning if a leaderboard would help motivate sales
      people and drive more sales. We started with intial research on the merits
      of leaderboards on sales organizations.

      While leaderboards were shown to improve sales numbers, they also had a
      potentially adverse affect on moral. From our previous research, motivation
      wasn't an issue for these sales people and I felt skeptical that it would
      have a positive effect.
